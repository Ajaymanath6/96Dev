# Canvas: create = new element

When the user asks to **create** something in the canvas (e.g. "create a card", "create another card", "create a button in the canvas") **without specifying a catalog UI id**:

- **Always add a NEW UI element** to the canvas. Do not update or replace an existing element.
- Treat "create X in the canvas" as: add a new element of that kind (with its own id, position, and content).

**Only update an existing element** when the user explicitly gives its **catalog UI id** (e.g. "update the card with id card-1", "change element-2 to ...").

## Summary

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Create a card in the canvas" | Add a **new** card element (new id, new instance). |
| "Create another card" | Add a **new** card element (do not modify the existing card). |
| "Create X in the canvas" (no id) | Add a **new** UI element. |
| "Update card-1 to ..." or "Change element id card-1 ..." | **Update** the existing element with that id. |

Unless the user specifies a catalog/UI id to change, **create** always means **add new**, not update.
