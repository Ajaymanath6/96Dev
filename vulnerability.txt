# Vulnerability / secrets audit

This file flags potential secrets or sensitive data in the project.

## Scan date

Generated as part of project setup.

## Findings

- No hardcoded API keys, passwords, or secrets were added in the initial setup.
- `.env*` files are listed in `.gitignore`; do not commit real secrets. Use environment variables in Vercel (or your host) for production.

## Recommendations

- Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` with real keys.
- Use Vercel (or your host) environment variables for API keys and secrets.
- Re-run a secrets scan when adding auth, payment, or third-party API integrations.
